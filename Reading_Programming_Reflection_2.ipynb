        "##Rules of Blackjack:\n",
        "\n",
        "###Card Scoring\n",
        "  - Numbers are worth face value\n",
        "  - Faces are worth 10\n",
        "  - Aces can be either 1 or 11\n",
        "\n",
        "### Playing the Game\n",
        " - Player and dealer are each dealt two cards\n",
        " - *One* of dealer's cards is face up for player to see\n",
        " - Player can choose to \"hit\" or \"stand\"\n",
        " - If player hits, they are given another card\n",
        " - If player card score is over 21, player busts. Dealer wins\n",
        " - Player can hit as many times as they choose\n",
        " - When player stands, it is dealer's turn\n",
        " - Dealer **must** hit if their hand is <= 16\n",
        " - Dealer continues to hit until they either bust (>21) or exceed 16\n",
        " - If neither Dealer or Player busts, the character with the highest hand value wins\n",
        " - if hands are equal, tie is referred to as a 'push'\n",

        "    - i.e. Dealer must hit if their hand is less than 16\n",
